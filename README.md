One-Stop Gen-AI Platform helps developers and creators by unifying AI code debugging and cinematic media generation. It detects and fixes syntax, runtime, and dependency issues with LLMs, while also generating scripts, videos, voices, lip-sync, and music using models like WizardCoder, Stable Diffusion, and Riffusion.
